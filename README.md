# pi-diff-review

This is pure slop, see: https://pi.dev/session/#d4ce533cedbd60040f2622dc3db950e2

It is my hope, that someone takes this idea and makes it gud.

Native diff review window for pi, powered by [Glimpse](https://github.com/hazat/glimpse) and Monaco.

```
pi install git:https://github.com/badlogic/pi-diff-review
```

## What it does

Adds a `/diff-review` command to pi.

The command:

1. collects the current git diff against `HEAD`
2. opens a native review window
3. shows changed files in a Monaco diff editor
4. lets you draft comments on the original side, modified side, or whole file
5. inserts the resulting feedback prompt into the pi editor when you submit

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Node.js 20+
- `pi` installed
- internet access for the Tailwind and Monaco CDNs used by the review window

### Windows notes

Glimpse now supports Windows. To build the native host during install you need:

- .NET 8 SDK
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime
